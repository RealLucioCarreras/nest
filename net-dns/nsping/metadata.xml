	Utility uses DNS queries to monitor reachability and operation of name-
	servers, as well as the latency of DNS queries. It does this by sending
	random recursive DNS queries to the nameserver (avoiding the effects of
	DNS caching) and measuring the amount of time between the sending of the
	query and the receipt of the response packet.
