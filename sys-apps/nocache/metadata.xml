	The nocache tool tries to minimize the effect an application has
	on the Linux file system cache. This is done by intercepting
	the open and close system calls and calling posix_fadvise with
	the POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED parameter. Because the library remembers
	which pages were already in file system cache when the file was opened,
	these will not be marked as "don't need", because other applications
	might need that, although they are not actively used (think: hot standby).
	Use case: backup processes that should not interfere with the present
	state of the cache.
