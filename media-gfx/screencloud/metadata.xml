	ScreenCloud is an easy to use screenshot tool, capable to take screenshot
	using one of the 3 hotkeys or simply by clicking the tray icon.
	There is a possibility to choose where you want to save your screenshot.
	If you choose to upload your screenshot to the screencloud website, a
	link will automatically be copied to your clipboard. You can share
	this link with your friends or colleagues via email or in an IM
	conversation. All they have to do is click the link and look at your screenshot.
	ScreenCloud also offers FTP and SFTP uploading if you want to use your own server.
