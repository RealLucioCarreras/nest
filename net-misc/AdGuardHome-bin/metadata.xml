	AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking.
	After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices,
	and you don't need any client-side software for that.
	It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains
	to a black hole, thus preventing your devices from connecting
	to those servers.
