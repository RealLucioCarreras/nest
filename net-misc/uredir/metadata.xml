	<longdescription>
	A small tool to redirect UDP connections.
	It can be used to forward connections on select external interfaces to loopback.
	In normal mode it forwards packets to a given destination and remembers
	the sender's address. Packets received from the given destination are forwarded
	to the sender.
	In echo mode uredir mirrors packets back to the sender.
	In inetd mode uredir lingers for three (3) seconds after forwarding a reply.
	This to prevent inetd from spawning new instances for multiple connections.
