	An open source cloud native runtime security tool. Falco makes it easy
	to consume kernel events, and enrich those events with information
	from Kubernetes and the rest of the cloud native stack. Falco has
	a rich rule set of security rules specifically built for Kubernetes,
	Linux, and cloud-native. If a rule is violated in a system,
	Falco will send an alert notifying the user of the violation and
	its severity.
