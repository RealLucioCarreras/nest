	<longdescription lang="en">
	PostgreSQL extension for high-performance time-series aggregation,
	designed to power realtime reporting and analytics applications.
	PipelineDB allows you to define continuous SQL queries that perpetually
	aggregate time-series data and store only the aggregate output in regular,
	queryable tables. You can think of this concept as extremely high-throughput,
	incrementally updated materialized views that never need to be manually refreshed.
	Raw time-series data is never written to disk, making PipelineDB extremely
	efficient for aggregation workloads.
	Continuous queries produce their own output streams, and thus can be chained
	together into arbitrary networks of continuous SQL.
