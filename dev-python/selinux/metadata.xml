	Pure-python selinux shim module for use in virtualenvs in oder to
	avoid failure to load selinux in Ansible modules.
	You still need to have libselinux python bindings package installed
	on your system for it to work but you no longer have the problem of
	not being able to import it from inside isolated (default) virtualenvs.
	This package was also tested as installed outside virtualenvs and seems
	not to interfere with the original library.
